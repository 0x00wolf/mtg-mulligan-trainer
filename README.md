# Magic the Gathering Mulligan Trainer
## Description:
I built this app to quickly simulate the act of shuffling, and drawing a hand in Magic the Gathering. This app allows players to create a custom deck, or edit the corresponding supplied decklists, and see a lot of starting hands in a very short time. It also allows users to draw additional cards. The general idea is to get used to seeing a lot of hands quickly to quickly develop a sense of what a good hand is for a given deck, and to try different iterations of popular decks and see how those iterations effect starting hands.
