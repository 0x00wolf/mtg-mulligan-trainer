# Magic the Gathering Mulligan Trainer
## Description:
I built this app to quickly simulate the act of shuffling, and drawing a hand in Magic the Gathering. This app allows players to create a custom deck, or edit the corresponding supplied decklists, and see a lot of starting hands in a very short time. It also allows users to draw additional cards. The general idea is to get used to seeing a lot of hands quickly to quickly develop a sense of what a good hand is for a given deck, and to try different iterations of popular decks and see how those iterations effect starting hands.

## Installation and Usage:
Clone the repository and run "python3 multrainer.py help" for usage instructions, or "python3 multrainer.py list-decks" to see the premade deck options. To edit the cards in the deck simply change the values in the corresponding text file in the decklists folder. There is a decklist.txt file for users to create their own custom lists, which can be used with "python3 multrainer.py decklist".
